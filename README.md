# Photon Design Tokens

A design token is an abstraction of a visual property such as color, font, width, animation, etc. These raw values are language application agnostic and once transformed and formatted can be used on any platform.

For example in CSS, design tokens are used as _variables_, though there will be conversions made for iOS and Android.

A design token file is written in [JSON](http://json.org/). For example this is a color token:

```
{
  "blue": {
    "50": "#0a84ff"
  }
}
```

And this is its conversion into a CSS variable:

```
:root {
  --blue-50: #0a84ff;
}
```

## Themes

Combine multiple tokens to customize frameworks and other dimensions. For Photon themes, see [https://github.com/firefoxux/photon-themes](https://github.com/firefoxux/photon-themes).
